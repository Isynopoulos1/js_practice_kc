###JAVASCRIPT PRACTICE | CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT

```
To develop an application implemented with Javascript to manage a students class.

Each requirement is assigned a number.
When we run the application, the complete list of requirements will appear.
The user must press the number corresponding to each requirement for it to be executed.
Once the execution is finished, we will show the list of requirements again so that the user can select another one.
If the user presses 0 or a number that is not contemplated, the application will finish.
